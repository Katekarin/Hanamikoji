Project about making card game "Hanamikoji" in html, css, js, learning to use more profesional methods and code organizing

Rules:
  Hanamikoji is a quick 2-player strategy card game about winning the favor of 7 geishas by offering them gifts.

Objective:
  Be the first to win the favor of 4 geishas or collect geishas worth 11 charm points in total.

Game Flow:
  Each player starts with 6 cards in hand.

There are 4 action tokens, and each player must use all of them once per round:

  Secret: Keep 1 card hidden until scoring,
  Discard: Remove 2 cards from the round face-down,
  Gift (1 vs 2): Offer 3 cards – opponent chooses 1, you keep the other 2,
  Gift (2 vs 2): Offer 2 pairs – opponent chooses 1 pair, you keep the other,

After all actions are used, reveal hidden cards and determine who has the majority value next to each geisha.

Place control markers:

  Player with more points next to a geisha gains her favor.

Ties mean the marker stays in place.

Check for victory:

  If no one has won yet, a new round begins with shuffled cards.
